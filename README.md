# 🌱 Growspent — Grow From What You Spend

**Turn your everyday spending into effortless investing.**  
Growspent automatically rounds up or adds a small % from each transaction and invests it intelligently based on your cash flow, goals, and risk profile.

> *"Money shouldn’t be something you manage — it should quietly grow with you."*

## 🚀 Overview

Most people *want* to invest, but few actually start.  
Budgeting feels restrictive, and investing feels complicated. Growspent fixes that by connecting to your existing spending habits and redirecting tiny amounts — round-ups or percentage add-ons — into growth automatically.

- **AI-Smart Investing:** adapts to your balance and spending pattern.
- **Multi-Bucket System:** emergency savings, debt paydown, and long-term investing.
- **Cash-Flow Aware:** pauses when money is tight, boosts when you can afford it.
- **Guilt-Free Experience:** no “you should save more” nags — just progress.
